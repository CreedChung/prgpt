# Privacy Policy for PrGPT

_Last updated: April 26, 2025_

PrGPT ("the Extension") is a Chrome extension that generates pull request titles and descriptions based on commit messages from GitHub.

## Data Collection

PrGPT does not collect or store any personal data. It only reads commit messages from the GitHub Pull Request creation page, processes them temporarily in-memory, and sends them securely to an external API for AI-based content generation.

## Use of Data

Commit messages are used solely for generating pull request titles and descriptions. No commit data, personal information, or browsing activity is stored, shared, or sold.

## Third-Party Services

PrGPT communicates with a secure external API to generate content based on commit messages. No personal information is transmitted.

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect any data transmitted during API communication. No data is permanently stored.

## User Rights

Since PrGPT does not collect personal information, users do not need to request access, deletion, or modification of their data.
